This directory (and a libxml2addon.py in parent directory) contains an ugly
hack which makes it possible to use pyxmpp with not patched libxml2.

This will probably work only with libxml2 version 2.5.7 (or _very_ similar),
and may even fail on systems a bit different than mine (copying config.h from 
libxml2 build tree may help then).

I hope proper interfaces will implemented in libxml2 soon and this hack will be
obsolete.

And the "fixes" are:

- TextReader interface is modified so Expand() doesn't wait for start of the
  next element - it returns node as soon as it's end tag is reached

- replaceNs method of xmlNode is added

- removeNs method of xmlNode is added

from libxml2)
