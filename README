============================================
PyXMPP2 â€“ Python Jabber/XMPP implementation
============================================

Introduction
------------

The goal of this project is to rewrite PyXMPP so:

- it doesn't rely on libxml2 any more
- it uses most current Python APIs
- its API is cleaned up
- etc.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 or 3.2
- `DNSPython`_  Limited functionality is available without it.

.. _DNSPython: http://www.dnspython.org/

Python 3 support
----------------

The source code is written for Python 2.7, but automated facilities are
available for conversion to 3.2. For this to work you need the `Distribute`_
package installed for Python 3.

.. _Distribute: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute

To build or install the py3k package run the ``setup.py`` script using the
Python 3 interpreter::

    python3 setup.py build
    python3 setup.py install

You may want to give ``--build-base py3-build`` option to build if you are
also building Python 2 version.

If you have the GNU Make utility (every Linux distribution provides it) you
may use ``make`` command instead::

    make py3-build
    make py3-install

Those will also make the Python3 version of the examples in the py3-examples
directory if you are using a GIT checkout (source distributions already
provide those).

As for now (2011-07-02) there is no official `DNSPython`_ release for
Python 3, you may want to check their `experimental branch`_.
