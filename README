PyXMPP -- Python Jabber/XMPPP implementation
============================================

\(c) 2003-2004 Jacek Konieczny <jajcus@jajcus.net>

This is PyXMPP - a python XMPP (RFC 3920,3921) and Jabber
(http://www.jabber.org/protocol/) implementation. It is based on libxml2 -
fast and fully-featured XML parser.

The goal is to make full-featured library for core XMPP/Jabber protocol support
(higher level protocols may be implemented in applications) for Jabber/XMPP
clients, servers and services. Currently it is mainly developed for CJC
(Console Jabber Client) and Jajcus' Jabber to IRC Gateway, so the client-side
of protocol and basic component interface are the most complete.

For PyXMPP you will need:
  - Python 2.3 (maybe it will work in 2.4 too)
  - recent libxml2 release (2.6.x) with python bindings. (http://xmlsoft.org/)
  - dnspython (http://www.pythondns.org/). PyXMPP is tested with version 1.3.2.
  - M2Crypto (http://sandbox.rulemaker.net/ngps/m2/) for TLS support.

To build the package just invoke::

	python setup.py build

To install it::

	python setup.py install

If you had some older version of PyXMPP it is better to uninstall it (delete
pyxmpp subdirectory os your site-packages directory) before installing this one
or things may not work correctly.
