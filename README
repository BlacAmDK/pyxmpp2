This is PyXMPP - a python XMPP module. It is based on libxml2 - fast and
fully-featured XML parser, so it has features like full namespace support,
XPath queries etc. 

The goal is to make full-fetured library for core XMPP/Jabber protocol support
(higher level protocols may be implemented in applications) for Jabber/XMPP clients,
servers and services. Currently it is mainly developed for CJC (Console Jabber Client),
so the client-side of protocol implementation is most complete.

To build the package just invoke:

	python setup.py build

To install it:

	python setup.py install

API documentation and more examples are coming soon (I hope)...
