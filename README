This is PyXMPP - a python XMPP module. It is based on libxml2 - fast and
fully-featured XML parser, so it has features like full namespace support,
XPath queries etc. 

Unfortunately original libxml2 doesn't work well with XML streams, so some
warkarounds had to be included - thats why this module is not 100% pure
python. There is also one more problem wiht libxml2 - its python binding are
quite low-level and not well integrated with Python's garbage collector 
- so it is easy to get Segmentation Fault when the module is used incorrectly.
However high-level pyxmpp functions and classes should be quite safe. 

To build the module just run:

python setup.py build

To install it:

python setup.py install

API documentation and more examples are coming soon...
