This is PyXMPP - a python XMPP module. It is based on libxml2 - fast and
fully-featured XML parser, so it has features like full namespace support,
XPath queries etc. 

This package also contains CJC - Console Jabber Client. When PyXMPP API stabilizes 
CJC will be separated, until then PyXMPP and CJC are developed together. You will find
CJC in the examples directory.

Unfortunately original libxml2 doesn't have a python interface which would work
well with XML streams, so custom extension had to be included - thats why this
module is not 100% pure python. 
There is also one more problem wiht libxml2 - its python binding are
quite low-level and not well integrated with Python's garbage collector 
- so it is easy to get Segmentation Fault when the module is used incorrectly.
However high-level pyxmpp functions and classes should be quite safe. 

To build the package just invoke:

	python setup.py build

To install it:

	python setup.py install

If you just want to play with the examples (including CJC) just invoke:

	make

then go to examples directory and play.

API documentation and more examples are coming soon (I hope)...
